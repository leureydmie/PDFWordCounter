# PDFWordCounter

## Description
This project consists in a simple word counter for PDF documents.

## Motivation
The motivation behind it is being able to easily get a rough estimate of the number of words in a PDF document without :
- Using expensive software ;
- Copy/Paste to another tool that does count words (not necessarily more complicated, but where's the fun with that ?) ;
- Sending documents on the Internet (I think I'm paranoid ...).

## Resources:
This tool relies on Apache PDFBox, that is distributed under Apache License v2.0.

The library is available here :
https://pdfbox.apache.org/

## Not supported (yet ?):
- Non-ASCII characters (they are simply ignored)
